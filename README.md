# Allen-Bradley L5X IP Scanner & Planner

A browser-based tool for scanning **Allen-Bradley L5X / XML** PLC project files.  
It extracts all IP addresses in use, links them to their corresponding modules/devices, groups them by first octet, and then suggests available IP addresses within those subnets.

Built as a **single HTML file** — no server, no dependencies, all processing is local in your browser.

## ✨ Features
- **L5X/XML Parser** – Reads and parses your Allen-Bradley project files directly in the browser.
- **IP Discovery** – Extracts all IPv4 addresses and links them to module/device names with context.
- **Subnet Grouping** – Automatically groups IPs by first octet (e.g., 10.x.x.x, 192.x.x.x).
- **Used vs. Available IPs** – Displays existing IP assignments and generates available IPs within the same /24 or custom CIDR range.
- **Filters** – Exclude `.0`, `.1`, `.255`, or already-used addresses.
- **Export & Print** – Save results as CSV or print directly from the browser.
- **GM-Themed UI** – General Motors blue & white color scheme with official GM brandmark.
